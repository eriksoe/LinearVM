\chapter{Function Providers}
Built-in functions in LinearVM are divided into different groups.
Each of these groups are managed by a \emph{function provider}.

There are function providers for some of the type constructors, for
native (FFI) functions, and for certain other special purposes.

% Function providers help during verification and load time - when a function is imported from the domain of a FP, the name and signature of that function is checked by the FP; if it does indeed provide a function with that name and signature, it... does so provide.

% Modification
% Partial/incremental creation and destruction
% Fork-join access?

\section{Unions}
% Creation

\section{Arrays}
% Arrays exist in two flavours: a) prefix initialized, b) all slots initialized.
% Arrays are paired with a) a length.
% Prefix-arrays are also paired with an initialization count.
