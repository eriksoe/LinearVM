\chapter{Verification algorithm}
\label{chap:verifier}

Integrity of a LinearVM instance is dependent on the well-formedness
of the code it loads.
An important part of well-formedness is type consistency.
At load time, the code files to be loaded are subject to \emph{code
  verification}, which is a series of checks that certain properties are fulfilled.

\section{Checks}

\begin{description}
\item[Syntactic conformance]
  The file must conform to the format described [in the ``File Format'' chapter].
\item[Index validity]
  All indices into sections must be valid.
  This includes IDs of:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Simple symbols
  \item Qualified symbols
  \item Types
  \end{itemize}

  It also includes byte-offset pointers into:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Symbol name source
  \end{itemize}
\item[Back-pointing index validity]
  Certain indices pointing from one section into that same code
  section are constrained such that the refered-to item must occur
  prior to (i.e., have a lower index than) the refering item.

  This includes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The ``parent'' element of a qualified-symbol (if non-null).
  \item Any type refered to in a type definition.
  \end{itemize}
\item[Liveness consistency of functions]
  Each function must be liveness consistent, as described [below].
\item[Type consistency of functions]
  Each function must be type consistent, as described [below].
\end{description}

\section{Liveness consistency}
At any point during the execution of a function, any register of the
function is in one of three states:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dead, i.e. not containing a value;
\item Live w/ reference, i.e. containing a reference;
\item Live w/ value, i.e. containing a value.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Liveness consistency} is a property of a function, stating that
regardless of the control flow path taken through the function,
\begin{itemize}
\item No register is read from if it is dead;
\item No register is written to if it is live w/ value;
\item When the function returns, no register is live w/ value.
\end{itemize}

%%% Lattice:
%%%        Top
%%%       /   \
%%%    Dead    \
%%%      |      \
%%%  Live-ref  Live-value
%%%       \      /
%%%        Bottom

\subsection{Lattice}
The join function for liveness state is defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
join(L_1, L_2) =
\begin{cases}
  L_1 & \text{if } L_1 = L_2,\\
  dead & \text{if } \{L_1,L_2\} = \{dead, live-ref\},\\
  top & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Boundary conditions}
At the beginning of the function, any register corresponding to a
value-parameter is live w/ value; any register corresponding to a
reference-parameter is live w/ reference; and any other register is
dead.

\subsection{Forward flow analysis}
The instructions are handled as follows:
